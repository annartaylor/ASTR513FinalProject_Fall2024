Chemical Equilibrium Perturbation Model using ODE Solver: Application to Venus

We first calculate the composition of Venus using a chemical equilibrium model. By minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the system using the gradient descent method we can calculate the chemical equilibrium composition of the atmosphere. Then we develop an ODE solver to time evolve the atmosphere given some change in conditions. We test this by seeing how the atmosphere would evolve if the Solar flux increased over time, which could be true during an active period or a solar flare.
