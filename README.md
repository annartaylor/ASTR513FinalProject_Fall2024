Chemical Equilibrium Perturbation Model using ODE Solver 

Starting with a chemical equilibrium model, we can introduce perturbations into the system, representing changes in solar radiation, impact events, or volcanic activity, and use the ODE solver to track how these perturbations affect the chemical makeup of the atmosphere over time. To do this we can introduce sudden or gradual changes in parameters or boundary conditions (e.g., a sudden increase in temperature or influx of new chemical species). For our model of Jupiter, we will introduce new boundary conditions and solve until we reach equilibrium and see how the model changes. 

Test cases 
1. Influx of water in the upper atmosphere from moons
2. Sudden temperature increase due to solar flare
3. Sudden increase in ammonium (NH4), hydrosulfide (SH), and acetylene (HCCH) due to Great Red Spot storm
